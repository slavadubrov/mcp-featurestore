# FeatureStoreLite MCP Server Example

This repository contains a lightweight example implementation of a Feature Store MCP (Model Context Protocol) server built with FastMCP and Python. It demonstrates how to create a custom MCP server that ML engineers can use to store and retrieve machine learning features through Claude Desktop.

## Purpose

This code serves as a practical companion to the blog article "Building a Custom FeatureStoreLite MCP Server Using uv" - a step-by-step guide showing how to build your own feature store MCP server from scratch, run it with **uv**, and integrate it seamlessly with Claude Desktop.

The implementation showcases:

- Setting up a FastMCP server with Python
- Creating feature store operations (store, retrieve, list features)
- Running the server through uv for easy dependency management
- Integrating with Claude Desktop for interactive ML workflows

Perfect for ML engineers looking to understand MCP server development and build their own specialized tools.
